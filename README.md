This was the final project for the STA302- Methods of Data Analysis I course at the University of Toronto. The topic 
of Life Expectancy was chosen to demonstrate various methods in choosing predictors for a durable linear regression model. The 
data is from Kaggle (cited in the Report document) and the analysis is done in R.
